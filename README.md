# EddyEye Pulse Dashboard Overview

**EddyEye Pulse Dashboard** is an R-based data visualization and analytics tool for monitoring and analyzing high-frequency (HF) environmental flux data from eddy covariance stations.

This dashboard mainly designed for **researchers** and **flux towers operators**, providing an intuitive interface for **quick assessment of HF data quality and overall eddy covariance system status**.
Users can easily visualize time series of key HF parameters, making it simple to spot anomalies or technical issues.
The dashboard is intended for practical, technical use, helping teams rapidly identify problems such as power outages, sensor or logger malfunctions, and interference from insects or animals.

**You can see a demo of the EddyEye Pulse Dashboard [here](https://svyatoslav-stack.github.io/EddyEye-Pulse-Dashboard/).**

**A detailed vignette is available:**
If you want a step-by-step explanation of the dashboardâ€™s structure and code, please see the [vignette](https://github.com/Svyatoslav-stack/EddyEye-Pulse-Dashboard/blob/main/vignette.md) included in this repository.
The vignette walks you through each code chunk, explaining how the dashboard connects to your database, checks data quality, visualizes measurements, and sets up automated alerts. This is especially useful for anyone who wants to adapt or extend the dashboard for new stations or additional parameters.
