# EddyEye Pulse Dashboard Overview

**EddyEye Pulse Dashboard** is an R-based data visualization and analytics tool for monitoring and analyzing high-frequency (HF) environmental flux data from eddy covariance stations.

This dashboard mainly designed for **researchers** and **flux towers operators**, providing an intuitive interface for **quick assessment of HF data quality and overall eddy covariance system status**.
Users can easily visualize time series of key HF parameters, making it simple to spot anomalies or technical issues.
The dashboard is intended for practical, technical use, helping teams rapidly identify problems such as power outages, sensor or logger malfunctions, and interference from insects or animals.

**You can see a demo of the EddyEye Pulse Dashboard [here](https://svyatoslav-stack.github.io/EddyEye-Pulse-Dashboard/).**
